- Win/lose conditions
- Bigger upgrade path
- 3D levels (above or below, some way to choose which direction to build)
- Multiple pictures of the same item for variety
- Having extra combines give more score and a 'special' version of the upgrade
- Moving objects (like bears)
   - have to detect when a group of them cannot move
- Enemies that downgrade buildings randomly
- Level editor
   - with a way to edit the upgrade hierarchy too?
- Tutorial levels
- Some way to get and spend 'money'
- Wild card type (like crystal)
- Animated placed items
- Extra animations for effect (e.g. people coming out of houses)

- For tutorial level
   - way to disable stash
   - way to control types of incoming items
   - way to show dialogs with text
   - way to highlight particular control

- is the upgrade hierarchy too large? It takes a LONG time to get the bigger things.
   - 4^5 grass = castle. This is 1024 grass. It's 4 castles for a treasure, so 4096 grass.
   - 4^3 sandpile = pyramid. This is only 64 sandpiles, or 256 for a treasure.

- Recipes - not just same type in arbitrary connected pattern
   - recipes need particular number and type connected
   - may need orientation or pattern direction
